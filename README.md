# Create Your Poemverse  
## Background
Using Poemverse, users are able to create a personalized anthology of some of the best works of verse available on the [PoetryDB](https://poetrydb.org/index.html)  

Booting up the site, users will be presented with a random poem pulled from the API and are presented the opportunity to refresh or save that poem to their 'My Verse' page.
  
Users can also add their own poetry to their anthology: putting their works side by side with some of the greats.
